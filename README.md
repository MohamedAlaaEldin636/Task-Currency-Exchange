# My Implementation

- Used the Recommended Architecture from the [Android Developers Official Page](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), That's why you see I use data, ui & the optional domain layers.

- Used MVVM approach to separate UI from logic and make the interaction only via view model as it serves as the mediator between them.

- Used Fragments with Jetpack Navigation Component to make use of
  [Single Activity Principle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k8x8V77CrU)

- Used Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations.

- Used [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) client for API communication.
